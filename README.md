# About-me

a)  Before GA I worked at a contemporary art gallery in downtown Denver for 2 years. Before that I received my masters in art history at CU Boulder where I also studied modern/contemporary art. My focus was on American sculptor Robert Smithson who made the infamous earthwork known as, "Spiral Jetty" located on the northern shore of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. I recommened visiting this place if you're ever out that way, its literally a 1500ft spiral made out of basalt rocks...and it's free.

b) Outcomes support I need: 
	- Job interview refreshing.
	- More about the type of careers I could get into.
	- How to make time for learning all this stuff!



Personal Goal: At the very least I would love to build a chrome (or mozilla) extension for spotify that enables one to see the full description for playlists and albums (not sure if you noticed but these descriptions are completely cut off on both the web player and the app and there is no way to expand the windows - really annoying).
	
	General Goal: to get hired! I want to work and learn!

d.    Two Truths and a Lie:

			1. I went to elementary school with someone whose father repaired a massive crack in the actual "Plymouth Rock" and told his daughters to put time capsules in it before they sealed it up.

			2. I have intimate knowlegde of fine arts black market.

			3. I once spun a coin and it stopped on its edge...
